# HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

![License:MIT](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

The goal for this challenge was to refactor a webpage so it meets accessibility standards so it is optimized for search engines. When viewing the source code, semantic HTML elements can be found which follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. When viewing icon and image elements accessible alt attributes are found. When viewing the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order and the title element is concise and descriptive.
